      <h1>Phillipian Seeks to Raise $500,000 Endowment</h1>
      Like so many local and national news outlets, <i>The Phillipian</i>, Phillips Academy's student-run newspaper, experienced financial difficulties following the 2008 economic downturn. The award-winning weekly paper, popular with students, alumni, and parents alike, has barely broken even in the past several years. To secure <i>The Phillipian</i>'s future&#8212;in print and online&#8212;the Academy is now seeking to fund a $500,000 endowment.</p>
      <p>Income from the endowment will primarily be used to enhance <i>The Phillipian</i>'s online presence via the purchase of new hardware, software, and online services; provide technology and equipment renewal; and enable on and off-campus learning, enrichment, and networking opportunities for Phillipian staffers. Students will continue to be responsible for generating advertising revenue, managing the paper like a small business, and producing each weekly issue within an established budget.</p>
      <h3>135 years and counting</h3>
      <p>
      	Since 1878, <i>The Phillipian</i> has provided Phillips Academy students with an uncensored voice. Thousands of students have been involved with the production of the newspaper and have gained remarkable experience as writers, journalists, editors, photographers, graphic designers, and business managers. A staff of student editors takes full responsibility for all editorial, financial, and operational decisions; values such as honesty, integrity, fairness, and civic responsibility are central to their work.</p>
      <h3>Fueled by pizza, coffee, and adrenaline</h3>
      <p>Editors spend many late-night hours in <i>The Phillipian</i> newsroom in the basement of Morse Hall&#8212;hunched in front of computers, examining page proofs, often subsisting on pizza, coffee, and adrenaline&#8212;as they run a small business operation with a strong academic component. The editorial staff takes seriously its responsibility to publish fair and accurate information and balanced perspectives, as well as a mandate to represent student opinion. <i>The Phillipian</i> experience challenges students in myriad ways. Each edition tests their critical thinking and decision-making skills.</p>
      <p>The reward is knowing that their newspaper&#8212;29 issues a year, 400-plus total pages&#8212;enhances PA's sense of purpose and community.</p>
      <h3>Tough times for newspapers</h3>
      <p>In 2010, the Academy granted permission for <i>The Phillipian</i>'s faculty advisors to convene an advisory board to help concerned editors secure the paper's financial health and navigate the rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>
      <p><i>The Phillipian</i> Advisory Committee recommended a number of cost-cutting and revenue-raising measures, which then-Editor in Chief Max Block '12 and successor Samuel Green '13, along with their editorial boards, effectively implemented. Most significantly, they renegotiated the newspaper's print contract with the <i>Eagle-Tribune</i>, cutting costs by nearly half.</p>
      <p>With the paper's immediate fiscal health restored, the committee turned its attention to assuring the long-term survival of the Academy's independent student voice in both print and digital formats.</p>

      <div id ="Part 2">
      <h1>Why an endowment?</h1>
      <p><i>The Phillipian</i>'s annual operating budget averages $55,000, most of which is spent on printing and mailing. Until recently, student subscriptions&#8212;and those of parents and alumni&#8212;have covered the bulk of these costs. But with an unprecedented 47 percent of students on financial aid, <i>The Phillipian</i> subscription fee has become too much for many families to bear; income from subscriptions continues to fall.</p>
      <p>To foster the ongoing success of <i>The Phillipian</i> while respecting its independence, the Academy is seeking to establish a $500,000 endowment, which would generate approximately $20,000 to $25,000 annually. These funds will be allocated as follows:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>to enhance <i>The Phillipian</i> Online via the purchase of new hardware, software, and annual online services (approx. $2,500 per year)</li>
      <li>to support technology and equipment renewal (approx. $2,500 per year)
      <li>to provide each student with a free hard copy of <i>The Phillipian</i></li>
      (approx. $12,000 per year)</li>
      <li>to enable on and off-campus learning, enrichment, and networking opportunities for Phillipian students (approx. $8,000 per year)</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div id ="Part 3">
      <h2>Endowment Income to Fund Ongoing Digital Initiatives</h2>
      <p>With a website, online image gallery, digital archives, and thousands of Twitter and Facebook followers, innovative Phillipian staffers have gone digital in multiple ways. But technology, apps, and online opportunities are ever changing, and there are multiple costs associated with maintaining a robust online and social media presence. Income from <i>The Phillipian</i> endowment will support:<p>
      <ul>
      <li><b>Website redesign</b>&#8212;to include a crawl that pulls from all Phillipian Twitter feeds and a complete front-end redesign that will streamline the online reader experience</li>
      <li><b>New iPhone App</b>&#8212;up to date with iOS 7 design schemes; will bring recent articles to iPhones for on and off-line viewing</li>
      <li><b>Escalated presence on Twitter</b>&#8212;to facilitate timelier online reporting
      <li><b>Greater use of Facebook</b>&#8212;to promote article, surveys, and events</li></ul>

      <h2> Tackling the Issues, Giving Students a Voice</h2>
      <p><i>The Phillipian</i> serves to inform the PA community of campus happenings, such as student performances, athletic contests, weekend activities, guest speakers, community news, and much more. Its highest purpose, however, is to give students a voice.</p>
      <p>Each week guarantees a fresh selection of opinion pieces and letters to the editor drafted mostly by students, with frequent submissions from faculty, alumni, and trustees. <i>The Phillipian</i> recently has fostered discussions about gender representation
      in campus leadership positions, a proposal for the Academy's divestment from fossil fuel companies, and an overhaul of the academic calendar.</p>
      <div id="Part 5">
      <h2>Mentoring & Networking</h2>
      <p>Phillipian students have benefited from conversations with numerous media professionals, including Susan Chira '76, assistant managing editor of <i>The New York Times</i>; Justin Smith '87, former president of <i>The Atlantic</i>; Mike Miller, deputy managing editor
      of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>; Dodie Kazanjian of <i>Vogue magazine</i>; Calvin "Tad" Tomkins of <i>The New Yorker</i>; Kuni Takahashi,
      AP Photographer of the Year; <i>Rolling Stone</i> journalist Michael Hastings; and <i>Boston Globe</i> sports photographer Jim Davis, as well as alumni writers and journalists such as Buzz Bissinger '72, Gary Lee '74, George Smith Jr. '83, and Greg Zorthian '71.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="Section 6">
    <h3>Off-Campus Learning Experiences</h3>
<p><i>The Phillipian</i> staff periodically attends journalism conferences, such as:</p>
<ul><li>The National Scholastic Press Association/Journalism Education Association National Conference in Washington, D.C., and Seattle</li>
<li>The Columbia University Scholastic Press Association Convention</li>
<li>The New England Scholastic Press Association Conference at Boston University</li>

    <h1> Quotes </h1>
    <div id="quote-Greg">
    <p>"<i>The Phillipian</i> has given me two of the greatest gifts possible: purpose and friendships." -Gregory Hosono '14, Online Editor</p>
    </div>
    <div id="quote-Stephen">
    <p>"There is not a single class at Andover where I could learn team management, fiscal planning, customer service, writing technique, and time budgeting all at once. The newsroom truly is Andover's greatest professional laboratory." -Stephen Moreland '14, Editor in Chief</p></div>
    <div id="quote-Emmie">
   <p>"Before joining <i>The Phillipian</i> I could not have imagined how much it would change my life at Andover. The paper makes me believe I can make a difference, right now and right here; that I am significant and that what I do matters." -Emmie Avvakumova '14, Photography Editor</p></div>
   <div id="quote-Janine">
   <p>"I work for <i>The Phillipian</i> because I can truly confront and dig into the issues that I believe matter to this campus. These are the things that my fellow editors and I lose sleep over. We can talk about the feminist movement in history or Betty Friedan in English, but I believe that we can learn more about these issues and about the people in the newsroom&#8212;arguing and fighting over them&#8212;than in any classroom. In the process, we learn about ourselves. We discover what we believe in, and what we will fight for, and what matters to us." -Janine Ko '14, Executive Editor</p></div>
   <div id="quote-Alter">
   <p>"[Learning how to synthesize large quantities of information] really started at <i>The Phillipian</i>, which was very important in my development. So did learning how to prepare for an interview with an important newsmaker. In the case of <i>The Phillipian</i>, it was Jimmy Hoffa, who was just out of prison and was friends with an Andover parent. He came to Andover, and when I asked him some hard questions, he turned to one of the thugs with him and said, 'Who is this kid?'" -Jonathan Alter '75, author and journalist</p></div>
   <div id="quote-Schwerin">
   <p>"<i>The Phillipian</i> was my first love. It was fascinating, exhilarating, and, more than any class ever did, it taught me how to write&#8212;how to form persuasive arguments and explain complex topics in simple and accessible prose. As Hillary Clinton's speechwriter, my audience is bigger but that sense of anticipation and responsibility is the same. And more than once, I've wished I still had Tom lyons or Nat Smith taking a red pen to my latest effort." -Dan Schwerin '00, speechwriter for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton</p></div>
   <div id="quote-Jones">
   <p>"Writing for Features and then serving on <i>The Phillipian</i>'s editorial board were critical aspects of my intellectual and personal development...[Skills and lessons learned] concerning leadership, responsibility, and commitment to excellence have remained with me throughout the years, informing my work as a writer/editor of the Harvard International Review during college. I have drawn upon them in my various professional roles&#8212;management consultant, lawyer, and educator." -Sara Su Jones '91, founder and president, Chicago-based Elite Education Testing</p></div></div></div>
