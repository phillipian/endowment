          <p>For 136 years, <i>The Phillipian</i> has served as a platform for student voices and an informant in campus discussion. Two years ago, the paper broke the <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2011/11/17/john-g-palfrey-named-fifteenth-head-school">story of John Palfrey's selection as the latest Head of School</a>. Last spring, we published a <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/02/28/letter-editor-0">series of Letters to the Editor</a> sparking a campus feminist movement that has gained national attention. Recently, we have run in-depth articles examining <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/09/12/shuman-slow-fall-admit-rate">Andover's declining acceptance rate</a>, <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/10/24/can-i-make-varsity-how-andover-athletes-have-made-jv-varsity-transition">the extent of mobility between our Varsity and Junior Varsity sports teams</a>, and the evolving conversation on diversity at Andover. We have extended beyond campus borders to <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/section/cross%20campus">co-byline stories</a> with a journalism class at Lawrence High School that tear down misconceptions and showcase the opinions of students from both schools.</p>

          <p>Arguably more important than its public role as a newspaper, however, <i>The Phillipian</i> also serves as the largest, most energetic student classroom on campus. Each week, the paper embodies the work of over one hundred students who disperse across campus to find and write hard-hitting news and commentary, edit each others' writing, and pull together a 12 to 16 page newspaper. We, as students, drive and own every step of the process, from thinking of story ideas to placing the final lines on the front page. We brainstorm and we discuss and we argue. We teach and we learn from each other.</p>

          <p>With the 2008 economic downturn, <i>The Phillipian</i> - like many local and national news outlets - faced financial difficulties. Despite strong support from students, alumni, and parents, we have barely broken even in the past several years. To secure <i>The Phillipian</i>'s future in perpetuity - both in print and online - the editorial board, in conjunction with decades of <i>Phillipian</i> alumni, now seek to fund a $500,000 endowment.</p>

          <p>Income from the endowment will upgrade our online presence, renew technology and equipment, enable on- and off-campus opportunities for future boards, decrease dependence on paid subscriptions and stabilize <i>The Phillipian</i> by covering a portion of its expenses. We will, of course, continue to manage the paper like a small business by generating advertising revenue and producing each issue within an annual budget.</p>

          <p><i>The Phillipian</i>'s annual operating budget averages $55,000, most of which is spent on printing and mailing. Until recently, subscriptions purchased by students, parents, and alumni have covered the bulk of these costs. But with an unprecedented 47 percent of students on financial aid, the <i>Phillipian</i> subscription fee has become too much for many families to bear; income from subscriptions continues to fall.</p>

One night, almost everybody was singing along to an old Simon & Garfunkel tune under their breath. They were all too focused on their own work to notice, but their voices momentarily formed a chorus. Maybe it is cliche, but that instant really epitomized the necessary balance between communal and individualistic strength that I find so characteristic of <i>The Phillipian</i>. The newsroom is a collection of very different people working towards a common goal, and only through complete dedication to our individual assignments can we produce the full paper."</p>

We watched Nordic videos on YouTube as he explained how to write a sports article, and at the time, I did not realize the significance of where I was or who he was. He told me writing for <i>The Phillipian</i> would be the hardest but most rewarding part of Andover, and since that day it has become an integral part of my life. I relished breaking lights out every Wednesday night of freshman winter waiting for the Nordic race results to come in, and thanks to <i>The Phillipian</i>, I now know that Ultimate Frisbee is a highly competitive sport and the pros and cons of man versus zone defense. More importantly, the paper has been a way for me to get to know the inspiring people around me, and seeing your work in the paper is the best feeling in the world."</p>

When you only have a couple seconds to grab somebody's interest and hopefully keep them asking for more, every character counts.

          <p>With over 40,000 pageviews each month, <i>The Phillipian</i> has taken significant strides to increase and maintain a robust online and social media presence. We now operate a <a href="http://www.phillipian.net">website</a>, online image gallery, <a href="http://archives.phillipian.net">digital archives</a>, and <a href="http://www.twitter.com/phillipian">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thephillipian">Facebook</a> accounts with hundreds of followers. Our Sports editors (<a href="https://twitter.com/phillipiansprts">@PhillipianSprts</a>) have over three hundred followers and tweet live coverage of nearly every home sport event from our associates and writers. Arts sends reporters out to weekend gallery events and concerts to bring back multimedia for online articles and <i>The Phillipian</i>'s active <a href="http://instagram.com/thephillipian">Instagram account</a>.</p>
          <div id="analytics-graph" class="pull-right col-md-5 col-sm-12" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 0 auto"></div>

          <p>Perhaps most significantly, the new focus online has engendered a larger shift in the foundations of the paper's weekly workflow. With the advent of a more active online presence, we now train our associates and writers to operate on a near 24-hour news schedule. No longer do we wait until Friday to upload the week's articles; we break our most pressing stories online. This fall, for example, we covered <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/10/05/grinding-banned-school-dances-inadequately-clothed-students-be-turned-away">a change in the school's dance dress code policy</a> online as it broke. Our editors worked through an entire Saturday to publish the article and tweet updates as we interviewed and clarified the new rules with our sources. The piece earned over 3,000 views in a day. Students responded - voiced their support or, more often, outrage - via Twitter and Facebook in real time. In turn, we published many of these responses as embedded quotes in the actual article.</p>

          <p>All in all, social media and the advent of online have changed the way we report the news. It has changed the way every newspaper reports the news. These technologies, however, are constantly changing. Thus the endowment will play a crucial role in making the transition to a digital-first newspaper in a digital-first world. Income from the endowment will support, most notably:</p>

          <ul class="pull-left col-md-7 col-sm-12">
            <li>Website redesign - to include a crawl that pulls from all <i>Phillipian</i> Twitter feeds and a complete front-end redesign that will streamline the online reader experience</li>
            <li>New iPhone App - up to date with iOS 7 design schemes; will bring recent articles to iPhones for on- and off-line viewing</li>
            <li>Escalated presence on Twitter - to facilitate timelier online reporting</li>
            <li>Greater use of Facebook - to promote article, surveys, and events</li>
          </ul>
