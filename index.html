          <p>For 136 years, <i>The Phillipian</i> has served as a platform for student voices and an informant in campus discussion. Two years ago, the paper broke the <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2011/11/17/john-g-palfrey-named-fifteenth-head-school">story of John Palfrey's selection as the latest Head of School</a>. Last spring, we published a <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/02/28/letter-editor-0">series of Letters to the Editor</a> sparking a campus feminist movement that has gained national attention. Recently, we have run in-depth articles examining <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/09/12/shuman-slow-fall-admit-rate">Andover's declining acceptance rate</a>, <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/articles/2013/10/24/can-i-make-varsity-how-andover-athletes-have-made-jv-varsity-transition">the extent of mobility between our Varsity and Junior Varsity sports teams</a>, and the evolving conversation on diversity at Andover. We have extended beyond campus borders to <a href="http://www.phillipian.net/section/cross%20campus">co-byline stories</a> with a journalism class at Lawrence High School that tear down misconceptions and showcase the opinions of students from both schools.</p>

          <p>Arguably more important than its public role as a newspaper, however, <i>The Phillipian</i> also serves as the largest, most energetic student classroom on campus. Each week, the paper embodies the work of over one hundred students who disperse across campus to find and write hard-hitting news and commentary, edit each others' writing, and pull together a 12 to 16 page newspaper. We, as students, drive and own every step of the process, from thinking of story ideas to placing the final lines on the front page. We brainstorm and we discuss and we argue. We teach and we learn from each other.</p>

          <p>With the 2008 economic downturn, <i>The Phillipian</i> - like many local and national news outlets - faced financial difficulties. Despite strong support from students, alumni, and parents, we have barely broken even in the past several years. To secure <i>The Phillipian</i>'s future in perpetuity - both in print and online - we, the editorial board, now seek to fund a $500,000 endowment.</p>

          <p>Income from the endowment will upgrade our online presence, renew technology and equipment, enable on- and off-campus opportunities for future boards, decrease dependence on paid subscriptions, and stabilize <i>The Phillipian</i> by covering a portion of its expenses. We will, of course, continue to manage the paper like a small business by generating advertising revenue and producing each issue within an annual budget.</p>

          <p><i>The Phillipian</i>'s annual operating budget averages $55,000, most of which is spent on printing and mailing. Until recently, subscriptions purchased by students, parents, and alumni have covered the bulk of these costs. But with an unprecedented 47 percent of students on financial aid, the <i>Phillipian</i> subscription fee has become too much for many families to bear; income from subscriptions continues to fall.</p>

          <p>To foster the ongoing success of <i>The Phillipian</i> while respecting its independence, the Academy is seeking to establish a $500,000 endowment, which would generate approximately $20,000 to $25,000 annually.</p>

        <div class="row-body col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-10">
          <p>With over 40,000 unique visitors each month, <i>The Phillipian</i> has taken significant strides to increasing and maintaining a robust online and social media presence. We now operate a website, online image gallery, digital archives, and Twitter and Facebook accounts with thousands of followers. Our Sports editors (<a href="https://twitter.com/phillipiansprts">@PhillipianSprts</a>) have over three hundred followers, and make use of an innovative system of tweeting and re-tweeting live coverage of nearly every home sport event from our associates and writers. Arts & Leisure has also taken well to the move to social media, sending reporters out to weekend gallery events and concerts equipped with iPhones and voice recorders in order to bring back multimedia to incorporate into online articles or fodder for <i>The Phillipian</i>'s active Instagram account.</p>

          <!-- <p>"In a world like this, where speed and convenience mean everything, social media grants small student run organizations like us the same access to tools used by huge businesses like the New York Times" says Andrew Zheng '15, a sports associate editor. "There's also nothing quite like cheering on the Big Blue while composing a tweet about the most recent scoring play, it's almost like an art form. When you only have a couple seconds to grab somebody's interest and hopefully keep them asking for more, every character counts. At my fingertips is the power to alter the newsfeeds of anybody who wants to stay connected to Andover sports and when you put it like that, the trek out to Siberia is worth it."</p> -->

          <p>Perhaps most significantly, the new focus online has engendered a larger shift in the foundations of the paper's weekly workflow. With the advent of a more active online presence, we now train our associates and writers to operate on a near 24-hour news schedule. No longer do we wait until Friday to upload the week's articles; we break our most pressing stories online. This fall, for example, we covered a change in the school's dance dress code policy online as it broke. Our editors worked through an entire Saturday to publish the article graf by graf, tweeting updates as we interviewed and clarified the new rules with our sources. The piece gained 3,000 views over the course of a day. Students responded - voiced their support or, more often, outrage - via Twitter and Facebook in real time. In turn, we published many of these responses as embedded quotes in the actual article.</p>

          <!-- <p>Justine Wang '15, a Copy Associate, says, "Our work doesn't just stop every Thursday afternoon before the paper is published. Over the weekends, while everyone is busy gathering articles and brainstorming ideas for the next issue, my fellow Copy Associates and I copy-edit online articles, usually notified through Facebook or text message, which the Online team immediately puts on the webpage. Because the online aspect of the paper is increasingly becoming more active, the live news aspect of <i>The Phillipian</i> is revolutionary in the world of high school online journalism."</p> -->

          <p>All in all, social media and the advent of online have changed the way we report the news. It has changed the way every newspaper reports the news. These technologies, however, are constantly changing. Thus the endowment will play a crucial role in making the transition to a digital-first newspaper in a digital-first world. Income from the endowment will support, most notably:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Website redesign - to include a crawl that pulls from all <i>Phillipian</i> Twitter feeds and a complete front-end redesign that will streamline the online reader experience</li>
            <li>New iPhone App - up to date with iOS 7 design schemes; will bring recent articles to iPhones for on- and off-line viewing</li>
            <li>Escalated presence on Twitter - to facilitate timelier online reporting</li>
            <li>Greater use of Facebook - to promote article, surveys, and events</li>
